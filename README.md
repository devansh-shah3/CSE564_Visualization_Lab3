# CSE564_Visualization_Lab3

The purpose: appreciate the techniques of volume rendering

Step 1: download ImageVis3D from here

Step 2: download the datasets from the same website
  - do not use the transfer function files also available there

Step 3: render 4 iso-surface images (8 points each)
  - two different datasets with different iso-surfaces shown

Step 4: render 2 images with multiple surfaces visible using semi-transparent rendering (8 points each)
  - pick from two different datasets
  - render the surfaces with different colors
